I am an experienced **leader**, **consultant**, **architect**, and **developer**, with my experience being built on shipping successful outcomes for enterprises large and small across a wide variety of industry verticals.

With broad and deep knowledge in digital strategy, agile delivery, team leadership, devops, and software engineering, I am in my element when working with businesses from the executive level to the developer level to deliver high quality, innovative, and impactful software solutions. I am a strong believer in continuous improvement, and constantly drive gradual, sustainable positive change in teams and organizations.

I'm currently enjoying honing my technical chops with the best in the business as a Principal Consultant at [Readify](https://readify.net/), along with exploring all of the challenges that working with people, teams, and businesses in a consulting role provides.
