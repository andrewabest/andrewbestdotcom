# Where?
I'm currently living in [Brisbane, Australia](https://time.is/Brisbane). 

# What am I doing now?

* Forming part of the Readify Queensland leadership group, in a Principal Consulting role
* Preparing ideas and content for an interactive, hands-on Delivery Training course within Readify together with my colleague [Mehdi Khalili](https://www.mehdi-khalili.com/) to deep-dive into all of the ingredients that go into a successful agile software delivery, and to help build our future leaders
* Contributing to a strategic roadmap to build deep AWS capability within Readify, as it is something I'm both passionate about and have had [some experience with](https://github.com/andrewabest/AWS-Workshop)
* Expanding my technical repertoire, with the next target on the list being Kubernetes, and _moving beyond PaaS_
* Mentoring [Rache / Goodo](https://twitter.com/rachegoodo) in the art of Ruby - a language I knew very little of when I started my mentoring journey with Rache, but am beginning to know a whole lot more of!
* Aligning a technical interviewing process, ensuring appropriate amounts of structure and guidance exist to promote even qualification and measurement of candidates across business units, without attempting to be perscriptive
* [Lean reading a book a month](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/lean-reading-a-book-a-month/)
