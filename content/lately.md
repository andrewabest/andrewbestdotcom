# Where?
I'm currently living in [Adelaide, Australia](https://time.is/Adelaide). 

# What am I doing now?

* Building the foundational Readify Adelaide team - if you are an awesome developer, data-er, or designer - [drop me an email](mailto:andrew.best@readify.net)! 
* Re-establishing my roots in the Adelaide tech community. Need a [speaker](https://www.andrew-best.com/speaking/) for an event? Want to talk about [solving problems](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-one/) that you and your team are currently tackling? Need someone to help represent technology within your business? I'm more than happy to buy the coffees ☕☕
* Still spending _100 hours with Kubernetes_, the minimum amount of time I feel is required to get a decent understanding of any complex tool
* Mentoring [Karma](https://www.codewithkarma.com/), a journeyman developer  and all around awesome human in our QLD team
* Mentoring [Rache / Goodo](https://twitter.com/rachegoodo) in the art of Ruby - a language I knew very little of when I started my mentoring journey with Rache, but am beginning to know a whole lot more of!

* [Lean reading a book a month](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/lean-reading-a-book-a-month/) 

## Previously

* Aligning a technical interviewing process, ensuring appropriate amounts of structure and guidance exist to promote even qualification and measurement of candidates across business units, without attempting to be perscriptive
* Preparing ideas and content for an interactive, hands-on Delivery Training course within Readify together with my colleague [Mehdi Khalili](https://www.mehdi-khalili.com/) to deep-dive into all of the ingredients that go into a successful agile software delivery, and to help build our future leaders
* Expanding my technical repertoire, namely experimenting with Azure Functions & AWS Lambda, [Phoenix Environments](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/phoenix-environments) in Azure via ARM + VSTS
* Empowering a talent aquisition team with a shorter path to success for promising candidates, using a combination of tech, pairing, education, and data
