Backstory
=========

A customer approached me recently, who works in a key ICT management position within a large, publically traded company. They stated that their company was keen to adopt agile methodologies, but were not sure where they should start. This person was keen for me to deliver some informal, brown-bag style educational sessions to start building some knowledge about the _why_, _what_, and _how_ of agile delivery. 

They gave me the following list of _areas_ of their business they would be inviting, along with their current perception of each areas represented interest within an agile delivery:

> **Business Partners** Capture and prioritise requirements. Ensure business case sufficient to justify investment
> 
> **Architecture** Ensure design of solution is sound and adhere to standards/overall strategy
> 
> **Project Delivery** Completion of work scope on time, within budget, at right quality
> 
> **Ops** Transition of build to operations and support 

This was a pretty good start! They were looking to bring a broad cross-section of their business and ICT capability together to learn about agile - which means as an organization they understand that software delivery is a collaborative effort, the responsibility of many, not just a few. The noted interests of each area would need some calibration, but we could skip the _"agile doesn't work in isolation"_ part of the syllabus.

I find the best way to start a conversation about agility is to first introduce all parties to a few ***Undeniable Truths of Software Delivery***:

* If you don't know your goals, the outcome doesn't matter
* The more software you attempt to deliver, the less likely you are to succeed
* Upfront analysis adheres to a law of diminishing returns
* Chaos and uncertainty are absolutes within software deliveries
* Software delivery in *any* methodology requires rigour and discipline to succeed
* If you can't measure your outcomes, you'll never know if you succeeded

I was in the process of building a slide deck to help facilitate the sessions. After capturing these _undeniable truths_, considering what I wanted to present, and shuffling a heap of placeholder slides around in the deck I was curating, I came to a taxonomy that I thought accurately reflected the structure of what I wanted to present:

***Discover, Decide, Deliver, Evaluate***. 

* *Discover* what our goals are, and what value we are looking to create for our business 
* *Decide* on a solution shape and budget, whether it represents a positive ROI and has an acceptable risk profile, and whether we should proceed
* *Deliver* the solution incrementally, embracing agile and lean tenents
* *Evaluate* whether the solution delivers the value assumed during discovery

I was hoping the parties who would be attending would eventually see that their involvement, whilst spiking and waning throughout a delivery, would be required _throughout_ the delivery, all aligned towards delivering valuable solutions that contribute to business goals.

The above structure may sound familiar to some, and certainly anyone studying agile or lean methods have likely come across many similar circular constructs:

[Colonel John Boyd's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) *Observe, Orient, Decide, Act*

[The Demming Cycle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA)  *Plan, Do, Check, Act*

[The Toyota Kata's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Kata) *Vision, Current Condition, Target Condition, Iterate*

All of these methodologies champion small iterative efforts, just-in-time or last-responsible-moment decision making, empirical observation, and continuous improvement. 

*Discover, Decide, Deliver, Evaluate* is a more opinionated and fitted towards how I and my teams deliver outcomes for customers, but is very much embracing the same fundamental principles. 

Discover
========
There are many reasons an enterprise may think they need to develop custom software. Software may already be a core part of their business strategy; they may be struggling to compete in their industry and need to differentiate; someone within the executive may have decided they _simply must_ have a thing (a [HiPPO](http://www.askahippo.com/) driven decision); there may be a clear pain that could be automated away; I see all of these with a reasonable amount of frequency.

The _two biggest mistakes_ that are made at this stage of a software initiative are:

* Jumping straight into solutioning
* Spending too long in up-front planning

Before we start talking about implementation detail, budgets, scopes, timeframes, teams, or anything else, we need to identify our utlimate goal. 

Why goals? Because **success in any software endeavour is not simply having software at the end**. It is not having this feature or that report. Software exists to serve humans who participate in business - sometimes within the business, sometimes as the customer. Ensuring we know the goals of our business, its strategies, and its envisioned future state, means we can hypothesize how software can enable that success. Goals provide focus and communicate intent within software endeavours.

There are many good ways to evaluate goals - some of them require more investment, and typically these are employed when there is less certainty or higher risk; and some less, employed when we have more context around our software initiative, and more alignment between stakeholders.

Here are some that I would typically recommend or employ. Some of them I can execute on my own with a customer or business, and some require a team of people to drive the effort. This list is ordered by the rough effort listed with each approach, with the most costly first:

* [Design Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) ~2-6 weeks
* [Design Sprints](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/) ~1 week
* [Impact Mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org/) ~4 hours
* Brainstorming, Affinity Mapping, and Multi-voting ~2-4 hours
* [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) for goals ~2 hours
* A [Mind Map](https://www.mindmup.com/) built with key decision makers ~1-2 hours

Regardless of the technique employed to create our goals, we want to make sure they are [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm).

**Impact Mapping** tends to hit the sweet spot of allowing you to both discover and quantify organizational goals, and connect that via a web of visual assumptions to a potential scope. I won't detail the technique here - [buy Gojko's book](https://www.impactmapping.org/book.html), it is a very easy read, and will prepare you well for applying the technique.

_A word of warning_: Impact mapping tends to lose its effectiveness if you have strong constraints on your solution space - i.e. if there is a mandate that all solutions are some sort of mobile app.

The top three techniques listed above also involve solutioning after the qualification of goals, and will leave you with a more-or-less fleshed out scope that you can input into  **Decide**. 

The last three techniques will require some solutioning on the back of the discussions / activities, however we can still ensure for any solutions that are proposed, all elements of scope will trace directly back to the identified goals.

Remember when I earlier stated:

> The more software you attempt to deliver, the less likely you are to succeed

If the scope discovered seems too large, this is a symptom of either too generic a goal, or aiming for too many goals at once. At any given time, we only want to be focussing on one goal per initiative or team. Doing so means we can give the team lazer-focus on achieving that goal, and closely scruitinize any potential solution scope to ensure it will support the goal, maximising our impact and minimizing waste.

TODO: Something about who should participate? Who will we impact / who will impact us / who percieves they may be impacted?

Once we have a clear goal established and agreed upon, that is SMART, and have identified a potential solution that could be produced that may take us toward that goal, the business needs to **Decide** whether it should proceed with the initiative, or not.
