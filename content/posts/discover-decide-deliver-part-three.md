_This is the final installment of a three part series in which I cover my methods of delivering successful business outcomes via software._

[Part One: Discover](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-one/)

[Part Two: Decide](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-two/)

[Part Three: Deliver](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-three/)

---

We have now [decided](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-two/) to proceed with a software initiative. We have a well defined goal, a high-level solution scope, an awareness of the risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies that exist, an idea on the potential ROI of the initiative, and most importantly: a budget within which we are confident we can succeed.

Now comes the hard part: actually delivering it!

Deliver
======

I'd like to preface this with a disclaimer: this is not an 'introduction to Agile' post. I don't need to arm you with ammunition as to why Waterfall / [BDUF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front) does not work in software - the internet is full of it! Most development teams, excepting the truly regressive, are no longer pounding out huge requirement specs and resisting change as they attempt to deliver something no one will actually want. Most teams understand that they are solving problems that pose high levels of [Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity), and to do so, they need to _be_ Agile.

If you're looking for a deeper primer on the _why_ of Agile software development, I highly recommend listening to [Kyle Aretae](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-aretae/) talk about [Diamond Agile](https://agileuprising.libsyn.com/diamond-agile) on the Agile Uprising podcast. As Kyle states, the basic tenants are always:

> Small teams, aggresive prioritization, feedback loops, small batches of work, long term investment.

TODO: Revise the following.

Instead I'd like to talk about some of the key _conditions_ businesses need to create and _behaviours_ teams need to exhibit to ensure success during delivery, and _dangers_ they need to be wary of along the way.

Conditions

_Strong Development Capability_

The backbone of a successful software delivery are strong software developers. There is no substitute for this capability. They are at the center of executing a given initiative, and need to be capable of doing so. This does not mean we expect all of our developers to be _[10x Developers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/179616/a-good-programmer-can-be-as-10x-times-more-productive-than-a-mediocre-one)_. However we expect the team to have a balance of skills that when wielded can solve the problems present in the delivery in efficient and effective ways.

Being able to attract, vet, retain, and grow strong software developers is a mandatory area of investment for any company that has bespoke software at its core. 

_One Team, One Dream_

Next to capability is culture. And this isn't just in the IT department, or the development team. This is within the organization. 

No "The Business", "IT". Just an outcome that everyone contributes to.

_Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose_

Dan Pink, Team, Time, Technology, Technique...

_Integrity, Trust, and Respect_

All activity in plain site.

_Discipline Is Mandatory_

Execution

_Always Be Setting Expectations_

Whilst it doesnt have the same ring to it as _Always Be Closing_, setting expectations is **the most important part** of software delivery. It should be the very first thing we do, and the very last thing we do. 

Business stakeholders with aligned expectations are connected to reality. They are armed with up-to-date information about the software initiative being delivered. They were well-primed at the start of it, they participate in constant feedback loops, they are supplied detailed summaries at short and frequent intervals, they are involved in all decision making, and they have an always-evolving but clear overall picture of the delivery. They feel like they are "on the journey" - one being directed by a competent and capable delivery engine.

Stakeholders who have been engaged and engage in this fashion are almost always satisfied at the end of a software delivery - there is no surprise, they know exactly how the end result was achieved at a detailed, nuanced level, as they were involved in producing it! 

Set expectations _on the first day_ regarding:

* What our goals are
* Who is responsible for what
* What we are doing
* What we are not doing
* How we will execute the delivery
* How we will work as a team
* Current known risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies 

_Get To Production ASAP_

Once the team and the wider group of organizational stakeholders and sponsors are primed and aligned, we want to make a bee-line for **production**. Ask the question:

> What is the most direct route from "nothing", to being able to ship "Hello World" to production, in a repeatable, reliable way?

Why go push so hard to get to production straight away? Surely the automation can wait right, we can F5 the software for a while and build some boilerplate or the first few small features before we sink effort into that endeavour? Or perhaps we can do some Right Click > Devops to a skeleton environment for a while?

Parting the sea to production allows the team to start shipping small, frequent increments for inspection reliably and repeatably. It is the primary conduit of our feedback loop. Feedback is important at many points, but none so much so than feedback on the working software produced and running in production. 

_Note: Sometimes we may not be able to provision a production environment due to constraints. This is okay, but still not optimal. Remember: there is no production-like, just not-production._

_Build, Measure, Learn_

Our team has a budget, and a goal or goals, that were agreed during our activities within [Discover](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-one/) and [Decide](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-two/). As soon as the delivery starts, we begin consuming our available budget. We need to make sure that we validate that expended budget is moving us towards our goal.

[Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), an approach born from the dotcom bust of the early 2000s which saw startups need to become much smarter with how they expended their capital, now that they were not being drowned in it, is a tool that allows us to do just that - validate that what we build is taking us towards, or away from our goals.

Building is a combination of creating and exploring hypotheses, and writing small amounts of code to test these hypotheses. All software requirements are just stacks of assumptions that in aggregate say "If we build these, then we hope we will accomplish our goals". The faster we can verify that each hypothesis, or the smallest set of requirements required to prove or disprove it 



"Only thing I thought of is adding something about how we work together to negotiate what's the best thing we can do for the investment we
want to make. And measuring and optimizing against metrics. Or something about getting to production quickly then making progress by proposing and testing hypotheses, via A/B tests or other"




_Embrace Reality_

Be brutal in communicating and adapting to reality.

No reality distortion fields.

Everything should support making the correct decisions within our present reality.

_Overcommunicate_

TODO: Something about who should participate? Who will we impact / who will impact us / who percieves they may be impacted?

_All Activity In Plain Sight_

Constantly emit data.



_One Eye On The Horizon, Code For Now_

_Pragmatism in all things_

_The Agile Divide_

Agile Project Management / Safe / Etc

/ anything that moves decision making further away from the core team.
