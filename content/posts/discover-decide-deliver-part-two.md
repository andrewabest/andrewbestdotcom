_This is the second part of a three part series in which I cover my methods of delivering outcomes via software, using a mixture of agility, lean methods, and common sense._

[Part One: Discover](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-one/)

[Part Two: Decide](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-two/)

Part Three: Deliver

---

We have now spent some time [Discovering](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-one/) potential problems or opportunities, ensuring we have identified goals that our delivery can contribute to, and spent a commensurate amount of time building a high level solution scope, we need to make a decision.

Should your business invest time and money in the proposed initiative?

I previously stated:

> The _two biggest mistakes_ that are made at this stage of a software initiative are:
> * Jumping straight into solutioning
> * Spending too long in up-front planning

The first problem, _jumping straight into solutioning_, we solved during [Discover](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/discover-decide-deliver-part-one/).

The second problem, _spending too long in up-front planning_, we solve **now** in **Decide**.

At this point we should have not yet invested an onerous amount of time and effort into discovering, and so will not be tempted to give into [Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy) when making a decision to proceed. 

Proceeding with a software initiative that is not likely to deliver an appropriate return on investment is not only costly from a financial point of view for the business, but the knowledge that the initiative is borderline profitable or worse tends to permeate the delivery. This leads to both substandard product development due to overly constrained resources, and to general negative impacts on delivery teams and cultures due to the oppresive nature of cut-throat product development.

So what is an appropriate return on investment?

3-10x. Anything lower than 3x should be considered risky if the 'return' is financial. 

How do we know how much effort it will take to deliver the proposed solution

Deciding should be quick, and based on empirical data.
